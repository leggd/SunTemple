Sun Temple Expedition Game

This is a turn-based game where two players explore a temple, collect valuable gems, and compete for the highest score. The game includes collecting gems and using strategic movements to outplay your opponent.

How to Play

Game Setup:
1. **Start a New Game**:
   - Two players will enter their names when prompted.
   - The game will initialize the temple board, and players will begin at the starting point.

2. **Turns**:
   - The first player is chosen at random.
   - Players will take turns to pick a movement chit from a list of options and advance their marker on the temple board.
   - Players collect gems or glass beads depending on where they land on the temple board.

3. **End of the Game**:
   - The game ends when one player exits the temple.
   - The player who has not exited the temple gets a bonus gem or glass bead randomly.

4. **Scoring**:
   - Players earn points based on the gems they collect:
     - 1 gem of a single type = 1 point
     - 2 gems of a single type = 3 points
     - 3 gems of a single type = 6 points
     - 4 gems of a single type = 10 points
     - 5 gems of a single type = 15 points
     - 6 gems of a single type = 18 points
     - 7 gems of a single type = 21 points
   - Each glass bead collected removes 1 point from the player's score.
